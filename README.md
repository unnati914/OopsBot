## **How It Works**

### **Architecture**
1. **Frontend**:  
   - Built entirely with Streamlit for simplicity and quick deployment.  
   - Users interact with dropdowns, sliders, and buttons to select options and generate excuses.

2. **Backend Logic**:  
   - Written in Python to generate excuses dynamically using predefined templates or randomization logic.  
   - Each excuse is crafted based on the chosen recipient and absurdity level.

3. **AI Integration (Optional)**:  
   - Optionally integrates with GPT-based APIs (e.g., OpenAI) for more creative excuses.

## **Future Features**
- **Save Favorites**: Allow users to bookmark their favorite excuses.  
- **Text Customization**: Let users add custom inputs like the recipientâ€™s name or a specific situation.  
- **Mobile Optimization**: Tailor the UI for mobile users.  
- **Daily Excuse Notifications**: Generate a daily excuse for fun!
